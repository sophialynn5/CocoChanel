# **Data Management Plan**

# **Project Description**

Our collection explores the life, fashion, and legacy of Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel, a designer who revolutionized the fashion industry. Chanel’s influence extends beyond clothing, redefining femininity through timeless styles that remain iconic today. This collection aims to document Chanel’s impact on modern fashion and cultural shifts, making it valuable to fashion historians, students, designers, and those interested in the evolution of style. The collection will include photographs, sketches, advertisements, fashion magazines, digital repositories, and articles, as well as items sourced from historical archives.
