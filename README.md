# CollectionBuilder-Sheets

CollectionBuilder-Sheets is a template for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV (such as a published Google Sheet!). 
This enables live collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.
Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server (*or built automatically and hosted for free on GitHub Pages!*).

Visit the [CB-Sheets demo site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/) to see it in action and even test your own metadata!

To learn more check [docs/sheets-metadata.md](docs/sheets-metadata.md) or visit the [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for step-by-step details for getting started and building collections.

Note that CB-Sheets is based on and mostly compatible with [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), but handles the metadata parsing in a fundamentally different way.

DSCI/LIB 350M Humanities Research Data Management

Instructor: Franny Gaede

Winter Term

In this class, we learn about the theory and practice of how people who work in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums manage data. We’ll look at & work with the different forms this data can take, such as images, video, sound, text, and maps, and examine the processes by which they are made available to interested humanities scholars.

Coco Chanel Collection

Our collection explores the life, fashion, and legacy of Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel, a designer who revolutionized the fashion industry. Chanel’s influence extends beyond clothing, redefining femininity through timeless styles that remain iconic today. This collection aims to document Chanel’s impact on modern fashion and cultural shifts, making it valuable to fashion historians, students, designers, and those interested in the evolution of style. The collection will include photographs, sketches, advertisements, fashion magazines, digital repositories, and articles, as well as items sourced from historical archives.

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
